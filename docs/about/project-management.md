# üóÇÔ∏è Project management

Even if Tabliss Custom Theme is a small-scale project, a minimum of organization is required to develop it.

To this end, the entire project is managed on [Github](https://github.com/).

## Code saving

In fact, I save the entire code on this hosting service so that I can access it at any time, anywhere.

What's more, a whole host of features are already in place to help you organize your project. Whether it's being able to exchange ideas with other users of the service on a whole range of subjects, obtaining a detailed history of every modification made to the project, or knowing the progress of a task, Github has become essential in the realization of my projects.

## Versionning

To keep track of all tasks, I've set up a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) of the project. When I'm developing a new feature that will involve major changes, or when I feel the project has reached a new milestone, I create what's known as a milestone. The milestone is made up of a multitude of tasks and represents an important stage in the project's progress.

Lorsque cette √©tape est franchie, une nouvelle version majeure est attribu√©e au projet (see all Tabliss Custom Theme project versions in the next section).
